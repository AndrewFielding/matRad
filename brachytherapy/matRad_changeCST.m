% Following a frequently prescribed planing dose of 15 Gy (Med Phys 39.5, pp.
% 2904â€“2929), the objectives are updated in the following way.


cst{6,6}{1}.parameters =  {15};

cst{8,6}{1}.parameters =  {7.5};

cst{1,6}{1}.parameters =  {7.5};

cst{5,6}{1}            =  cst{6,6}{1};

cst{6,6}               =  [];

% the planing target was changed to the clinical segmentation of the
% prostate bed.
% In this example, the lymph nodes will not be part of the treatment:
