# Additional scripts folder
This folder contains scripts and additional functions that are not directly relevant for matRad functionality.
Nontheless, they might be useful.

## How can they be useful if they are not relevant?
Here are some examples: 
- matRad_structstruct visualizes the tree structure of a struct variable. In MatRad, this proves to be very helpful.
- matRad_eulerRot implements an euler rotation that can be used licence free.
- the matRad_plot... functions help visualize perts used in the dose calculation formalism
