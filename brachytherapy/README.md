# Brachytherapy in MatRad
This is a planing tool for brachytherapy oriented at the matRad structures. 

## Structure:
There is one function _matRadBrachy.m_ in the main folder to control the workflow.
It uses the original matRad functions, additional Brachy functions with prefix "matRadBrachy_" and the functions stored in this folder. 
(No changes where made inside any original MatRad Functions.)
